## How to implement with `<img>` tags

1. Download the __walnut__ folder and add it to your project.

2. Add this to your HTML, I recommend at the bottom, just before `</body>` (change `src` path to fit your project):
	```javascript
	<script id="walnutScript" src="/walnut/walnut.js"></script>
	```
3. Add `class="walnut"` to the container/containers including images you want to show in the slider

4. Done! So simple!


### How to implement with `background-image: url()`

1. Download the __walnut__ folder and add it to your project.

2. Add this to your HTML, I recommend at the bottom, just before `</body>` (change `src` path to fit your project):
	```javascript
	<script id="walnutScript" src="/walnut/walnut.js"></script>
	```
3. Add `walnut-image` as an attribute to the container/containers including images you want to show in the slider
  `<div style="background-image: url('images/example.jpg'); width: 200px; height: 200px;" walnut-image></div>`
  It's also possible to use `class="walnut-image"`

4. Add `class="walnut-image"` to the element with the background-image css.

5. Done! So simple!
