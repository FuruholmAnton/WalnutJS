## How to use with `<img>` tags

1. Download the __walnut__ folder and add it to your project.

2. Add this to your HTML, I recommend at the bottom, just before `</body>` (change `src` path to fit your project):
	```javascript
	<script id="walnutScript" src="/walnut/walnut.js"></script>
	```
3. Add `class="walnut"` to the container/containers including images you want to show in the slider

4. Done! So simple!
